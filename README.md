# DSO Graph WebApp

A lightweight web application built with **Streamlit** to visualize waveform data captured from a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO). The tool allows easy upload and display of voltage-time graphs, enabling quick waveform interpretation and analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Digital Storage Oscilloscopes (DSOs) often export waveform data in raw or unstructured formats, which can be difficult to interpret without a proper visualization tool. Manual plotting is time-consuming and limits real-time understanding.

### ✅ Objective
To build a simple and interactive Streamlit web app for:
- Uploading `.csv` waveform data files
- Extracting and visualizing signal amplitude (voltage) vs time
- Supporting clean, scrollable, zoomable graph interfaces

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** (for optional graph rendering)

## 🚀 How to use

1. **Open the URL in your browser**
2. **upload you CSV data from DSO and download structured CSV file for analysis**
3. **modify frequency as needed for visualization (Optional)**
